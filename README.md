A pipeline to a) detect, classify, and remove isolated discontinuities
from Kepler light curves; b) and remove the systematics trends from
the light curves using public co-trending basis vectors (CBV),
variational Bayes, and shrinkage priors.

The pipeline consists of a Python package `oxksc` and two command line scripts:

- `keplerjc`: jump detection, classification, and removal
- `keplersc`: variational Bayes-based systematics removal 

The scripts can be used to process Kepler light curves individually or in a batch
with automatic MPI parallelisation.

and install

    cd OxKeplerSC
    python setup.py install [--user]

## Dependencies

numpy, scipy, astropy, matplotlib, tqdm

## Description

### Jump detection, classification, and removal

The jump detection routines model the Kepler light curve as a Gaussian
process (GP), and scan for discontinuities in the GP covariance matrix.
Basic model selection approach is used to classify the identified 
discontinuities (between a jump, transit, and flare), and the discontinuities
identified as jumps are corrected.

The detection, classification, and correction routines can be directly
accessed from `oxksc` package under `oxksc.jc`, or the `keplerjc` script 
can be used to correct Kepler light curves in MAST format.

### Systematics correction

The systematics removal routines use the co-trending basis vectors (CBVs) derived by the
Kepler PDC-MAP pipeline and published on the MAST archive to detrend
individual Kepler light curves. Like the PDC-MAP pipeline, each light
curve is modelled as a linear combination of CBVs. However, here this
model is implemented in a Variational Bayes (VB) framework, where the
priors over the weights associated with each CBV are optimized to
maximse the marginal likelihood of hte model. Because we use zero-mean
Gaussian priors for the weights, with hyper-priors on the widths of
those priors centred on zero, any CBV not strongly supported by the
data is not used in the final model. This approach, known as automatic
relevance determination (ARD) or shrinkage, reduces the risk of
overfitting. As the CBVs are derived from the Kepler light curves and
contain some noise, it also reduces the amount of noise injected into
the light curves by the correction, including on planetary transit
(few hour) timescales. Finally, it also preserves intrinsic stellar
variability more successfully than the standard PDC-MAP pipeline.

The systematics correction routines can be accessed directly from the
`oxksc` module under `oxksc.cbvc`, or the `keplersc` script can be 
used to correct Kepler light curves in MAST format. For best results,
`keplersc` should be ran for light curves that have already been corrected for
jumps with `keplerj`.

## More information

See Aigrain, Parvianen, Roberts & Evans (2017). An
older version of our Kepler systematics correction, using the same
VB-ARD framework, but our own basis vector discovery, was described in
Roberts, McQuillan, Reece & Aigrain (2013).
